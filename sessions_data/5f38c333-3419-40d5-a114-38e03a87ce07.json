Many areas have specialized units for domestic violence and dowry harassment.\n\n2. **Legal Protections**: In countries like India, the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, and Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code offer legal recourse against dowry demands and domestic abuse.\n\n3. **Seek Legal Advice**: Consult a lawyer specializing in family or domestic law for guidance on your rights and legal procedures.\n\n4. **Support Services**: Reach out to organizations that provide support for domestic violence and dowry harassment victims, offering counseling and legal advice.\n\n5. **Gather Evidence**: Document harassment instances, such as messages or financial records, to support any legal action.\n\nYour safety is the priority. If in immediate danger, contact emergency services or a trusted individual.",
