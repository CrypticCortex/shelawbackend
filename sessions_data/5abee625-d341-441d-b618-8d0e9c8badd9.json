Here are some steps you can consider:\n\n1. **Legal Help**: Familiarize yourself with laws like the Indian Penal Code (Section 498A) and the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, which protect against dowry harassment.\n\n2. **Contact Authorities**: File a complaint with your local police. Many stations have women's help desks for such cases.\n\n3. **Women's Organizations**: Reach out to the National Commission for Women (NCW) for guidance and support. Check their [helpline page](http://www.ncw.nic.in/helplines) for assistance.\n\n4. **Support System**: Connect with friends, family, or support groups for emotional and practical support.\n\n5. **Safe Shelter**: If in danger, consider moving to a women's shelter or a trusted person's home.\n\nRemember, help is available, and you are not alone. Prioritize your safety and well-being.",
