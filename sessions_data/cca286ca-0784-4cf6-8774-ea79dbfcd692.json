Consult a family law lawyer for guidance.\n\n2. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of dowry demands or harassment, including messages and emails, to use as evidence.\n\n3. **Counseling and Mediation**: Discuss the issue with your husband for support and consider family counseling or mediation to resolve disputes amicably.\n\n4. **Support Networks**: Contact support groups or organizations for guidance, emotional support, and legal advice.\n\n5. **Safety and Well-being**: Prioritize your safety. If threatened, find a safe place and involve law enforcement if necessary.\n\nConsult a legal professional to tailor these options to your situation.",
