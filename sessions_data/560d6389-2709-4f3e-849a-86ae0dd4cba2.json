      "content": "Hello Kalyan! I'm sorry to hear about your dowry issue. Here are some key insights and suggestions:\n\n1. **Understanding the Dowry System**: The dowry system involves parental wealth transfer to the groom's family at marriage, often linked to gender inequality and potential violence against women.\n\n2. **Responding to Dowry Demands**: Firmly communicate your values about marriage being based on equality rather than financial transactions. Calm discussions about the negative implications of dowry can be effective.\n\n3. **Seek Support**: If the situation escalates, reach out to family, friends, or organizations that advocate against dowry practices for guidance and assistance.\n\n4. **Legal Recourse**: Know your legal rights; demanding dowry is illegal in India under the Dowry Prohibition Act, which provides protections against harassment.\n\nFeel free to share more details if you need specific advice or assistance.",
