      "content": "In India, marital rape is not explicitly criminalized under the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Section 375 includes an exception for marital rape for wives over 18. However, Section 498A addresses cruelty by a husband or his relatives, which can be used if the husband's actions constitute cruelty, including physical or mental harm. Additionally, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, offers protection and relief from domestic violence, covering sexual abuse within marriage. This act allows for protection orders, residence orders, and monetary relief. Consulting a legal professional is recommended to explore these options.",
