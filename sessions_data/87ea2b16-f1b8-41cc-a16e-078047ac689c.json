      "content": "The Nirbhaya case involved the brutal gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in December 2012 in Delhi, India. Six attackers were involved, with one being a juvenile who received a three-year sentence in a reform facility. The four adult attackers were convicted and sentenced to death, a verdict upheld by the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court of India. They were charged under sections of the IPC, including murder and rape. The Supreme Court dismissed their appeals and any further petitions. The case led to major legal reforms in India, introducing stricter punishments for sexual assault and fast-tracking similar cases, and sparked nationwide discussions on women's safety.",
